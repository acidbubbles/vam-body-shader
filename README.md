# Virt-A-Mate Body Shader Plugin

Apply any shader to actors in Virt-A-Mate!

**This plugin has been abandoned. VaM uses shaders to actually place people on the screen, so fiddling with it breaks movement completely. It'll only work with the T-pose, and even then will not work very well.**

## About

When I made the [improved-pov](https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-improved-pov), I played a lot with transparency while testing. But Skeet actually saw something I did not: goo girls! So while explaining how the technique could be applied to any imported shaders, I decided against my sanity to try and make this an easy base plugin to experiment with.

## Credits

- Skeet, for taking the time to prove the concept, find the missing pieces for the body and sharing back what he did!
