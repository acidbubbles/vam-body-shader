Apply any shader to actors in Virt-A-Mate!

_This plugin is not yet usable_

## About

When I made the [improved-pov](https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-improved-pov), I played a lot with transparency while testing. But Skeet actually saw something I did not: goo girls! So while explaining how the technique could be applied to any imported shaders, I decided against my sanity to try and make this an easy base plugin to experiment with.

## Credits

- See the original plugin's [credits](https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-improved-pov#credits)
- Skeet, for taking the time to prove the concept, find the missing pieces for the body and sharing back what he did!
